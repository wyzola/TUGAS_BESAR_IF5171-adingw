        "* Setiap bulan PLN memiliki data DLPD yang dapat diunduh sesuai dengan bulan terbitnya rekening listrik pelanggan setiap bulan. Dan sebagai tindaklanjut DLPD tersebut, petugas PLN melakukan pengecekan ke lokasi pelanggan. Kegiatan ini rutin dilakukan setiap bulan. Namun hal ini dirasa kurang efektif, karena tidak semua DLPD merupakan fraud. Oleh karena itu model yang dibangun adalah membantu mencari DLPD yang berpotensi melakukan fraud/normal/tidak terpakai.\n",
        "* DLPD dikelompokkan menjadi beberapa kategori anomali pelanggan antara lain:\n",
        "  1. KWH < 40 JAM NYALA : Jam Nyala Maksimum perbulan adalah 24 Jam x 30 Hari = 270 Jam Nyala. Data yang ditampilkan adalah yang kurang dari 40 Jam Nyala per bulan dimana pemakaian kWh pelanggan termasuk kecil.\n",
        "  2. KWH < 50% DARI RATA-RATA : Total pemakaian energi listrik pelanggan Lebih Kecil dari 50% rata-rata bulanan\n",
        "  3. KWH > 50% DARI RATA-RATA : Total pemakaian energi listrik pelanggan Lebih Besar dari 50% rata-rata bulanan\n",
        "  4. REKENING PECAHAN : Rekening yang timbul akibat perubahan daya. Perhitungan Rp/kWh daya lama dan Rp/kWh daya baru dihitung secara akurat sesuai dengan angka meter pada saat pergantian daya di lokasi rumah pelanggan.\n",
        "  5. KWH NOL : Terjadi jika angka meter bulan sebelumnya dan angka meter saat pembacaan saat ini tidak ada pergerakan/NOL. Mengindikasikan rumah kosong, kwh macet/rusak, dsb.\n",
        "  6. STAND METER MUNDUR : Angka meter bulan lalu lebih besar daripada angka meter bulan saat ini.\n",
        "  7. KWH MAXIMUM : Pemakaian kWh terlalu tinggi. Terjadi pada pelanggan dengan Jam Nyala lebih dari 720 Jam Nyala per bulan.\n",
